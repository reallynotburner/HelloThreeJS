## Instructions

* Start it - `npm start`

## Content

* Initially, we have a floating torus with a single light source
* Started with https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene tutorial
* But I _really_ needed the window to resize dynamically, without stretching or squishing the renderer, so I fixed it.
* The webpack boilerplate is from https://github.com/jpggvilaca/webpack-boilerplate.git and is excellent for getting a project up and running in a minimal amount of time.
